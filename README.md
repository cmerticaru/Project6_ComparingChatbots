# Welcome to the Final Project!

## The Main Goal 

Make a comparison of 2 models of chatbots for a task based chatbot and test the accuracy of the bots

## Project Description

## Project Goals and Requirements 


### Chatbot - topic choice - Why?

Why did I choose the topic of NLP for building a chatbot?
I am currently working on my aspiration to go into the Product Management direction.
with the Product Management mindset in sight I wanted to investigate the possibilities of building a product in the form of a chatbot, which can serve the purpose of acting as a first interface with the customers by providing simple answers to most frequently asked questions.
As I work in Collections the chatbot is a Finance related one.

### Folder Structure
chatbot with Chatterbot - folder with Chatterbot model, training data files, graphic user interface for the bot
chatbot with Keras and NLTK - folder with model using NLTK and Keras, intent file
testing 2 different chatbot models - the transcripts of the tests of the 2 bots, data gathered, data analysis

# Necessary Deliverables

* **Project repository** <br>

repository includes:
   - A **.gitignore**  file that blocks any images and datafiles, 
   - A **README file** to guide the reader through the project and files and also have a functional file structure. The README file should clearly include which topic you chose and which are the questions you would like to find an answer to. 
   - **Python files** and **Jupyter notebooks**<br>
